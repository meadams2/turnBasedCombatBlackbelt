Defining Character Module

This module will contain:
1. A function to fight.
2. Defining the Character Class.

This module is closely based off of meadams2_tbc.py. 

Define a new class Character:
	Define new function called __init__(self):
		self.name gets name
		self.maxDamage gets maxDamage
		self.hitChance gets hitChance
		self.hitPoints gets hitPoints
		self.armor gets armor
	Property: characterName. Takes character name.

	Property: hitPoints. Takes value. Integer with no max or min. Determines 	how much damage the character can sustain. Is possible to be negative or 0.
	
	hitPoint.Setter
		Checks if value type is an integer. If not an integer, default is 		10

	Property: hitChance. Takes value. Integer from 0-100. Determines the 	likelihood a hit will be successful. 

	hitChance.setter
		Uses testInt() to make sure value is within 0-100 and is an 			integer.

	Property: maxDamage. Takes value. Positive integer. The largest amount of 	damage a single hit will sustain. 

	maxDamage.setter
		Uses testInt() to make sure value is an integer greater than or equal to 0. 

	Property: armor. Takes value. Positive integer. The number of hits absorbed by character armor

	armor.setter
		Uses testInt() to make sure value is integer greater than or equal to 0. 
	
	Define printStats():
		Takes no parameters
		Prints character name, hitPoints, hitChance, maxDamage, and armor. Returns characterStats. 
	
	Define hit():
		Takes self and enemy
		Uses hitChance to determine if hit lands. Hit lands when random integer (1-100) is less than or equal to hitChance.
		If hit lands, determine the hitDamage using random integer (0-maxDamage)
		Else, hitDamage gets 0.
		Subtract armor from hitDamage.
		Subtract hitDamage from hitPoints
		Return enemy.hitPoints
Define fight()
	Takes character1, character2
	Orchestrates series of turns and runs until one character is defeated(ie. hitPoints is 0)
